Jacobi method
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

In numerical linear algebra, the Jacobi method (or Jacobi iterative method[1]) is an algorithm for determining the solutions of a diagonally dominant system of linear equations. Each diagonal element is solved for, and an approximate value is plugged in. The process is then iterated until it converges. This algorithm is a stripped-down version of the Jacobi transformation method of matrix diagonalization. The method is named after Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi.
